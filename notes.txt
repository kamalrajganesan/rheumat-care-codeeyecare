CODE Eye Care - Rheumatology Interface Application

  I've analyzed the HTML file. Here's a comprehensive breakdown of the application:

  Application Overview

  A medical data entry and reporting system for ophthalmology-rheumatology interface care. It allows healthcare professionals to document patient visits, track medications, and generate printable summaries.

  Core Functionalities

  1. Patient & Visit Management

  - Patient identification (name, MR number)
  - Rheumatologist information
  - Visit type categorization

  2. Rheumatologist Sheet

  - Systemic diagnosis tracking (11 conditions including Sjogren's, RA, SLE, etc.)
  - Serology status, disease status, treatment targets
  - Lab values (ESR, CRP, disease activity scores)
  - Clinical impressions

  3. Medication Management

  - Systemic medications tracking
  - Dosage details for specific medications
  - HCQ cumulative dose calculator (automatic calculation)

  4. Three Specialized Modules

  CRIS (Cornea-Rheumat Interface)
  - Dry eye assessment (DEQ5 scores)
  - Schirmer's test results (bilateral)
  - Corneal staining severity
  - Topical medication tracking
  - Emergency condition flags (scleritis, PUK, perforation)
  - Surgical clearance status

  URIS (Uvea-Rheumat Interface)
  - Uveitis classification (anatomical & nature)
  - Episode tracking and patterns
  - Differential diagnosis options
  - Topical treatment protocols
  - Action items and coordination needs

  HCQ Screening
  - Baseline and follow-up screening
  - Test tracking (OCT, fundus photo, HVF, MF-ERG)
  - Toxicity assessment

  5. Output Features

  - Real-time print preview (right panel)
  - PDF generation (print to PDF)
  - CSV export for data analysis
  - No data storage (privacy-focused)

  UI/UX Observations

  - Clean, modern card-based design
  - Responsive two-column grid layout
  - Sticky header for persistent access to actions
  - Conditional field display (reduces clutter)
  - Real-time summary updates
  - Status pills for module completion tracking

  Technical Stack (Current)

  - Vanilla JavaScript
  - CSS custom properties
  - Single HTML file (~1000 lines)

  Recommended Angular Architecture

  Based on this analysis, I'll create an Angular application with:

  Structure:
  - Feature-based modules (CRIS, URIS, HCQ)
  - Reactive forms with validation
  - Component composition
  - Services for business logic
  - Angular Material UI components
  - Responsive design (desktop-first, per your requirement)

  Best Practices:
  - TypeScript strict mode
  - Standalone components (Angular 15+)
  - RxJS for state management
  - Signal-based reactivity (Angular 16+)
  - Lazy loading for modules
  - Accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
  - Print-optimized CSS
